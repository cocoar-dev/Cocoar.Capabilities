# ADR: Introduce Owner and Anchor Support in `CapabilityScope`

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Context:** Applies to `Cocoar.Capabilities` (framework-level enhancement)
**Decision Type:** Backward-compatible API extension

---

## 🧠 Context

A `CapabilityScope` represents the lifecycle boundary for compositions. In many real-world systems, scopes are not conceptually isolated — they frequently originate from or are strongly associated with a *root subject*, such as:

| Scenario                       | Root Subject                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| A configuration system         | Configuration manager/context              |
| A plugin framework             | Hosting module                             |
| A workflow engine              | Workflow definition or execution container |
| A multi-tenant platform        | Tenant context                             |
| A pipeline or builder instance | Pipeline host object                       |

In such environments, code may later receive only the `CapabilityScope`, yet still need to enrich or inspect capabilities belonging to a specific, central subject tied to that scope (e.g., the manager, tenant, or engine).

Today, there is no first-class way to associate or retrieve such “anchor subjects” from the scope. As a result, extension code must pass additional references around manually, or incorrectly treat the scope itself as a subject — which is semantically misleading.

---

## ✅ Decision

We introduce a structured way to associate a scope with well-known subjects via **anchors**, along with a single optional **Owner** for clarity in scenarios where one subject is considered canonical.

### The `CapabilityScope` will now support:

| Concept           | Cardinality          | Purpose                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**         | 0 or 1               | A distinguished, primary subject that conceptually owns or leads this scope.                        |
| **Typed Anchors** | ≤ 1 per `Type`       | Allows retrieval of a known subject by known type.                                                  |
| **Named Anchors** | ≤ 1 per `string` key | Enables flexible contextual attachments (e.g., `"tenant:acme"`, `"environment"`, `"pipeline:foo"`). |

### API characteristics

✅ Anchors are stored as `WeakReference<object>` to prevent memory leaks.
✅ **Owner safety**: `Owner.Set()` throws if owner already set; use `Owner.Replace()` for explicit replacement.
✅ **Fluent chaining**: API returns self for fluent chaining; use `.Scope` to return to scope
✅ Retrieval is explicit via `Owner.TryGet`, `Anchors.Get<T>()`, and `Anchors.TryGet()`.
✅ Ergonomic sugar will exist for composing directly from owner/anchors:

```csharp
scope.Owner.Compose()
scope.Owner.Compose<T>()
scope.Anchors.Compose<T>()
scope.Anchors.Compose("key")
```

✅ Anchors are optional; existing usage continues to work without modification.
✅ `Owner` is a convenience anchor with semantic weight — but it is not mandatory.
✅ **Grouped API**: All owner operations under `scope.Owner.*`, all anchor operations under `scope.Anchors.*`

---

## ✨ Example Usage

```csharp
// During scope initialization (e.g., in a host object)
scope.Owner.Set(this).Scope  // Throws if called twice (use Replace for replacement)
     .Anchors.Set<PipelineHost>(this).Scope
     .Anchors.Set("environment", envContext);

// Replacement scenario (explicit overwrite)
scope.Owner.Replace(newHost);  // Explicit replacement allowed

// Later – only scope is known:
var host = scope.Owner.Get<PipelineHost>();
scope.Compose(host).Add(new PipelineDiagnosticsCapability()).Build();

// Via owner/anchor composition:
scope.Owner.Compose().Add(new PipelineDiagnosticsCapability()).Build();

// Via typed or named anchors:
var env = scope.Anchors.Get<EnvironmentContext>();
scope.Anchors.Compose<EnvironmentContext>().Add(new EnvironmentCapability()).Build();
```

## 📍 Rationale

This design:

| Benefit                                                                                 | Explanation |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✅ Enables composition against meaningful subjects even when only the scope is available |             |
| ✅ General-purpose (not tied to any specific domain or consumer)                         |             |
| ✅ Future-proof (supports multi-tenant, multi-context, module-based architectures)       |             |
| ✅ Improves clarity vs. attaching capabilities to the scope itself                       |             |
| ✅ Weak references avoid retention issues                                                |             |
| ✅ Backward compatible                                                                   |             |

## 📉 Alternatives Considered (and Rejected)

| Option                                       | Rejected Because                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Only a single Owner (no anchors)             | Too restrictive for scenarios with multiple contextual subjects                |
| Only anchors (no Owner)                      | Loses clarity in cases where one subject is clearly primary                    |
| Attaching capabilities directly to the scope | Blurs semantics — scope is a container, not a subject                          |
| Ambient context (`AsyncLocal`, static)       | Implicit, harder to reason about, unsuitable for parallel scopes               |
| Parent/child scopes                          | More complex than needed for this use case; may still be added later if needed |

---

## 📦 Consequences

✅ Extension scenarios are now easier and more expressive
✅ Small cognitive overhead: users must understand the distinction between scope, owner, and anchor subjects
✅ Responsibility is on the scope creator to correctly assign anchors
✅ Attempts to resolve missing or GC’d anchors result in `false` (for `Try...`) or exceptions (for `...OrThrow`)

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Implement Owner and anchor APIs with weak references               | ✅      |
| Add `Owner.Set()` safety check (throw on duplicate)                | ✅      |
| Add `Owner.Replace()` for explicit owner replacement               | ✅      |
| Group API into `scope.Owner.*` and `scope.Anchors.*`              | ✅      |

| Add unit tests for anchor retrieval, GC cleanup, and failure cases | ✅      |
| Add tests for Owner.Set/Replace safety behavior                    | ✅      |
| Update documentation (README, ADR, quick reference)                | ✅      |

## ✅ Outcome

`CapabilityScope` becomes contextual, extensible, and aware of its originating subject(s) without compromising immutability, safety, or generality.
