These benchmarks reflect various capability system usage patterns:

dotnet run -c Release -- --job short --filter "*QueryDatabaseStrategy*"

### Small Applications (10 subjects × 50 capabilities)

- **Microservices**: Service configurations with monitoring, auth, validation```

- **Configuration Systems**: Application settings with validation and caching

- **Plugin Systems**: Limited plugin count with rich capability sets# List available benchmarks and their full names- Small bags (~20 capabilities): Very fast to build and query



### Large Applications (1000 subjects × 50 capabilities)  BenchmarkDotNet emits Markdown and HTML reports under `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results`.

- **Enterprise Systems**: Many services with standard capability sets

- **Game Engines**: Many entities with consistent behavior capabilitiesdotnet run -c Release -- --list flat  - Build: ~9–10 µs; Lookup (single tag): ~120 ns

## Reading Results

### Extreme Scale (1000 subjects × 500 capabilities)

- **IoT Platforms**: Massive device counts with extensive telemetry  - Eager is ~3× faster at lookup but costs more to build; only worth it if you’ll do ~80–100+ lookups per bag lifetime.

- **Analytics Systems**: Complex data processing with rich transformations

- **AI/ML Pipelines**: Many models with extensive configuration capabilities- Focus on relative differences between operations; absolute times vary per machine



## Performance Tuning Insights- **Build vs Query trade-offs**: Building compositions has one-time cost, queries are frequent# Run a specific method (wildcards allowed)- Large bags (≥1000 capabilities): Prefer `TagIndexing=Eager` (Auto picks this by default).



### When to Use Different Patterns- **Primary capabilities** offer the fastest lookup path for singleton services



**Primary Capabilities**: Use for strategy selection, singleton services- **Ordered capabilities** (like validation) maintain performance while providing sequencingdotnet run -c Release -- --job short --filter "*LookupSmallBag*"  - Lookups: ~10× faster and near zero allocations; intersections benefit too.

- ✅ Ultra-fast lookup (~70 ns)

- ✅ Perfect for DI container integration
