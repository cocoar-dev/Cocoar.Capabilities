# Security Policy

## Supported versions
The latest main branch and the most recent release are supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for potential vulnerabilities. Instead:
- Email: bwi@cocoar.dev (or use your private channel if you have one)
- Include a minimal reproduction, impact assessment, and affected versions/commits.
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours.

## Disclosure
We prefer coordinated disclosure. After a fix is available, weâ€™ll publish release notes with mitigation guidance.
